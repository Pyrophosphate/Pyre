**README**

Pyre (working title) is an in-progress terminal-based Roguelike game.

Currently, there is little more for the player to do than control the classic '@' symbol around an empty room (with the arrow keys). There is one "enemy," though neither of you can actually hurt the other; it is there only to develop the turn dynamic and rudimentary AI systems and components.

Development so far has been around the core ECS (Entity-Component-System) design framework, wherein game objects are built out of a series of reuseable components, which are then operated on by a number of systems. Examples to come.

This project has no external dependancies (yet...) and can easily be built with Maven.
